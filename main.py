    Countdown timer 
    June 18th 2025

    1.) Allow the user to input the time
    2.) Count down to 0
    3.) Tell the user that the time is up.

    Im thinking that there is going to have to be some kind of for loop.
    Will this timer countdown in minutes and seconds or just seconds?

stringMinutes = input("Please set a time to countdown(In minutes): ")
print(stringMinutes)
